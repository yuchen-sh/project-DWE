* **<font size=4> Project Overview </font>**

  * The intersection of virtual and physical realms gives rise to distinctive security concerns, encompassing inter-realm adversarial attacks creating counterfeit representations, the risk of information leakage across distributed virtual reality devices, and the exposure of user privacy at both the network and application levels. These less-recognized threats arise from the intricate interplay and added complexity of the digital realm, coupled with the reliance on cutting-edge technologies like digital mapping, machine learning, and data analysis in mixed environments. In response to these challenges, the project develops pioneering strategies to fortify the metaverse ecosystem, with the goal of creating secure, resilient, and privacy-enhanced digital world experiences. The project's broader significance and importance span digital twin networks, manufacturing, and automation testing, where the developed security and privacy prevention techniques can be employed in various data analysis tasks, including medical data processing, road traffic prediction, user mobility, and trajectory predictions. The project integrates the research insights into new modules for computer security and privacy courses and hosts outreach activities like Data Privacy Week.
